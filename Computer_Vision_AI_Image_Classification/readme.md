Natural images are classified using Artificial intelligence method. 

Input used:- Natural images - which consist of 8 different classes including airplane, car, cat, dog, flower, fruit, motorbike and person. 

Models trained to classify natural images:- Convolution neural network (CNN) base model, VGG16 CNN architecture and InceptionV3 (GooLeNet) CNN architecture. 

Result: 
1. All the CNN architecture works significently better. 
2. VGG16 CNN architecture give highest accuracy which is 98% for 10 epochs on test data.
3. Both CNN base architecture and InceptionV3 CNN architecture is in the range of 85-90% accuracy on test data.
